# GPU-CPU-Distribution-Visualization
This project helps a system engineer of an organization organize and analyze data which are fetched from company's resource usage database, including date, queued time, task running time, CPU/GPU numbers, and CPU/GPU using hours. 

[clusterusagereport.py](https://github.com/yuyao-cyber/GPU-CPU-Distribution-Visualization/blob/main/clusterusagereport.py) aims to find the occupancy rate of CPU and GPU in different tasks. It also finds the total using rate of CPU/GPU per day.

[boxplot.ipynb](https://github.com/yuyao-cyber/GPU-CPU-Distribution-Visualization/blob/main/boxplot.ipynb) generalizes boxplots of month vs queued time, running time, CPU/GPU numbers, and CPU/GPU hours.

[3d_plot.ipymb](https://github.com/yuyao-cyber/GPU-CPU-Distribution-Visualization/blob/main/3d_plot.ipynb) generalizes 3d version plots of queued time, running time, and CPU/GPU numbers to get a better visualization of their relations.
